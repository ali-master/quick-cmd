## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### QuickCMD icon not visible in menubar
- **Cause**: Menubar might be crowded
- **Solution**: Look for overflow indicators (>>) on the right side of menubar
- **Alternative**: Use global shortcut `âŒ˜ + Space`

#### Global shortcut not working
- **Cause**: Another app might be using the same shortcut
- **Solution**: Quit other apps temporarily to test
- **Future**: Custom shortcut configuration will be available

#### Commands not executing
- **Cause**: Insufficient permissions or command doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Check that the command works in Terminal first
- **Check**: Ensure QuickCMD has necessary permissions in System Preferences

#### Window appears in wrong position
- **Cause**: Display configuration changes
- **Solution**: Restart QuickCMD to reset positioning
- **Future**: Position preferences will be configurable

### Performance Issues

#### Slow search results
- **Cause**: Large number of commands
- **Solution**: Use favorites for frequently accessed commands
- **Tip**: Clear command history if needed (future feature)

#### High memory usage
- **Cause**: Rare issue with command history
- **Solution**: Restart QuickCMD
- **Contact**: Report if issue persists
